# Imoet
Simple library from my daily code. All script in this library are gathered from all my project that i`ve worked on.
Picked only the usefull, generic and easy to use. Mostly i gathered from my Unity project, but i converted it so it`s compatible to the .NET Framework.

I use .NET Framework 3.5 as base framework for this project because i want to make this library available for wider version of .NET.
You can use this library freely. I hope this libraray can be usefull for your project.
